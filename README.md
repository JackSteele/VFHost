# VFHost - work in progress
#### VFHost is a (currently) very simple GUI for hosting Linux VMs on macOS Big Sur's Virtualization.framework.

## Building
Open `VFHost.xcodeproj`, add your certificate, and you're off to the races.

## Binaries
**None at this time.** Application is very immature.

## Known issues
**Too many to list at this time.** Application is very immature.

## Similar projects
**[evansm7/vftool](https://github.com/evansm7/vftool)** - this is a more mature (CLI-only) wrapper for Virtualization.framework
